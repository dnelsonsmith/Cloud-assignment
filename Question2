0 0 * * 0 tar -czvf /home/user/backup.tar.gz /home/user && rsync -avz /home/user/backup.tar.gz user@192.168.1.100:/home/user/backups/


Explanation:

0 0 * * 0: Runs the command every Sunday at midnight (00:00).
tar -czvf /home/user/backup.tar.gz /home/user: Creates a compressed backup of the /home/user folder.
&&: Ensures the second command runs only if the first one succeeds.
rsync -avz /home/user/backup.tar.gz user@192.168.1.100:/home/user/backups/: Transfers the backup to the remote server using SSH, preserving permissions and compressing data for efficiency.
Authentication configuration:

Set up SSH keys:
Generate an SSH key pair on the local machine: ssh-keygen
Copy the public key to the remote server: ssh-copy-id user@192.168.1.100
Alternatively, use a password:
The cron job will prompt for the user's password when connecting to the remote server.
Additional notes:

Adjust paths: Change the paths to the backup file and remote destination as needed.
Test manually: Before setting the cron job, test the backup and transfer commands manually to ensure they work correctly.
Monitor logs: Check cron logs for any errors or issues with the backup process.
Consider security: Implement additional security measures, such as encryption and access controls, for sensitive data.
